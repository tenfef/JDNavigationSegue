JDNavigationSegue
=================

A UISplitViewController Segue for Storyboards that will push the navigation controller with no animation.

It pushes the UISplitViewController's detail controller without animation.
The built in segues always animate and this was annoying to me.

It's super simple that it doesn't need complaining but for the noobs:

* Import the files into your project
* Create a new segue.
* Select "Custom" from the drop down and enter JDNavigationSegue" in the "Segue Class" field.
